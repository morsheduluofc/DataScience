# DataScience Projects
This project uses different dataset for six different data science projects that are based on: (i) Exploratory Data Analysis for ML, (ii) Supervised ML: Regression, (iii) Supervised ML: Classification, (iv) Unsupervised ML, (v) Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, (vi) Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis.

* Linear Regression: It will predict house price based on available features (e.g., number of bedroom, bathroom, floor etc.) by using Linear Regression. See the implementation in LinearRegression.ipynb file.
* Polynomial Regression: It will predict the salary of an employee based on the year of experiences by using Polynomial Regression. See the implementation in PolynomialRegression.ipynb file.
* Support Vector Regression: It will predict marks based on the hours of study by using Support Vector Regression. See the implementation in SupportVectorRegression.ipynb file.
* Decision Tress Regression: It will predict the revenue based on temperature from the Icecream dataset by using Decision Tress Regression. See the implementation in TreeForestRegression.ipynb file
* Random Forest Regression: It will predict the revenue based on the temperature from Icecream dataset by using Random Forest Regression. See the implementation in TreeForestRegression.ipynb file
